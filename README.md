# FileSyncConsole
Sync files between 2 folders, limited to a maximum folder size, with the newest files being synced.

Current Version: 1.0.0.0 - 

### About
This was a project I worked on for a friend, who wanted a way to automatically sync the latest x GB of data from a source folder, to a removable drive.  They also wanted only the lastest items and while they could do this manually, they asked if I could come up with an automatic method.  File Sync Console does just that.

### Requirements
- Windows Operating System
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.7.2 (or Greater)
